    "# Alpha and Beta of a Given Instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "*Alpha* (α) measures the excess return of an investment above its expected return, given its level of risk. It represents the value added by an investment manager or strategy, relative to a benchmark index.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Beta* (β) measures the volatility or systematic risk of an investment relative to the broader market. It quantifies how closely an investment’s returns follow the market’s returns.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alpha:\n",
    "   - Positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark, while negative alpha indicates underperformance.\n",
    "   - A higher alpha value indicates greater excess return above the benchmark.\n",
    "### Beta:\n",
    "   - Beta greater than 1 indicates an investment is more volatile than the market (high-risk).\n",
    "   - Beta equal to 1 indicates an investment has the same volatility as the market (neutral).\n",
    "   - Beta less than 1 indicates an investment is less volatile than the market (low-risk).\n",
    "   - Beta equal to 0 indicates an investment has no correlation with the market (e.g., a bond).\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Suppose a stock has an alpha of 2% and a beta of 1.2. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The stock’s expected return is 2% higher than the benchmark index, given its level of risk.\n",
    "   - The stock’s volatility is 20% higher than the market’s volatility (1.2 × market volatility).\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that alpha and beta are backward-looking measures, meaning they reflect historical performance. They do not guarantee future results.\n"
