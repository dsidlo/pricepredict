    "# Pair Trading Analysis\n",
    "  \n",
    "Given a pair of stocks that are Conintegrated, grab their PricePredict Objects from the\n",
    "ppo/ directory and plot a median/spread graph of the two stocks. This will allow us to see\n",
    "how the two stocks are moving relative to each other and if there are any opportunities to\n",
    "trade the spread between the two stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run a simple trading simulation that uses a strategy of trading the 2 stocks at the same time\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "* Opening a Pairs Trade...\n",
    "    * When the 2 stocks diverge and the stock that is overvalued is more than the historical standard deviation\n",
    "      from the mean (based on N most profitable moves) and the undervalued stock is more than the historical \n",
    "      standard deviation from the mean (etc.). \n",
    "        * Sell the overvalued stock and buy the undervalued stock.\n",
    "          Only do these trades if the prediction for the next day indicates that the overvalued stock\n",
    "          is going to go down and the undervalued stock is going to go up on on the current timeframe,\n",
    "          and on the next higher timeframe (weekly, given a daily trading timeframe).\n",
    "          Then buy/sell the stocks at the opening price of the next day.\n",
    "        * Use additional indicators that indicate a reversal in the spread (as needed). \n",
    "    * Do we trade from convergence?\n",
    "        * It does not make sense to trade from convergence, as it is difficult to determine which\n",
    "          stock to go long on and which stock to go short on.\n",
    "        * We should only trade from divergence, as we can determine which stock is overvalued and which\n",
    "          stock is undervalued. \n",
    "* Closing a Pairs Trade...\n",
    "    * Given an open Pairs Trade that started from a Spread Divergence... \n",
    "        * We wait for the spread to converge to the median and then close the trade.\n",
    "        * We then calculate the profit/loss of the trade and add it to the total profit/loss.\n",
    "* How to choose going long vs going short (one stock will be long and the other short)...\n",
    "    * The Spread calculation is essentially the difference between the two stocks. Stock_A - Stock_B.\n",
    "        * As Stock_A goes up and Stock_B goes down, the spread will increase (go up in the spread graph).\n",
    "        * As Stock_A goes down and Stock_B goes up, the spread will decrease (go down in the spread graph).    \n",
    "    * If the spread is above 2 standard deviations from the mean, we go short on Stock_A and long on Stock_B.\n",
    "    * If the spread is below 2 standard deviations from the mean, we go long on Stock_A and short on Stock_B.\n",
    "* How much to trade...\n",
    "    * We use the Hedge Ratio to determine how much of each stock to trade.\n",
    "        * The Hedge Ratio is the Beta from the OLS regression of Stock_A on Stock_B.\n",
    "    * The Hedge Ratio is the amount of Stock_B that is needed to hedge the risk of Stock_A.\n",
    "        * If the Hedge Ratio is 1.5, then we would trade 1.5 shares of Stock_B for every 1 share of Stock_A.\n",
    "        * If the Hedge Ratio is negative (-1.5), then for every 1 share of Stock_B, we would trade 1.5 shares of Stock_A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which is a stronger indicator of Cointegration...\n",
    "    * Weekly or Daily?\n",
    "    * Both are useful much the way a weekly prediction indicates the longer term trend and a daily prediction\n",
    "      indicates the shorter term trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different start-end periods result in different Hedge Ratios and Spread Deviations.\n",
    "    * Longer timeframes (5yrs vs 30days) result in lower Hedge Ratios and Spread Deviations. It takes longer for the spread to converge.\n",
    "* It probably makes sense to hold on to the data for a given trading pair trade entry so that one can\n",
    "  continue to track the move to the originally calculate median (exit point), sticking to the original\n",
    "  trading plan. We add more data to the close columns and we calculate the spread and the current spread\n",
    "  the original Beta/Hedge Ratio, while the median (our exit point) stays the same.\n",
