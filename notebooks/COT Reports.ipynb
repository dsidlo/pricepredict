    "- Financial Markets AI\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Commitments of Traders (COT) reports are limited to reporting positions that exceed a certain minimum threshold of holdings. This threshold ensures that the COT reports capture significant positions by larger traders, which are typically more informative for understanding market dynamics.\n",

    "## Key Points About COT Report Thresholds:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reporting Threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CFTC sets specific reporting thresholds for different futures and options contracts. These thresholds represent the minimum number of contracts a trader must hold to be classified as a reportable trader.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholds vary by commodity and contract type. For example, the threshold might be lower for agricultural commodities and higher for major financial instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reportable Positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Positions that meet or exceed the established thresholds are considered \"reportable\" and must be submitted to the CFTC by clearing members, futures commission merchants (FCMs), and foreign brokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Traders with reportable positions are categorized into distinct groups such as commercial, non-commercial, and non-reportable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Reported Positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller positions that do not meet the threshold are categorized under “non-reportable positions.” These are aggregated and reported collectively in the COT report, without specific details.\n",
